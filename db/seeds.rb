# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
User.create(email: 'user1@example.com', password: 'password', password_confirmation: 'password', first_name: 'きんぐ', last_name: 'すらいむ', send_mail: true)
